Let's start with some, something a little, unusual. 
<pause>
A Chinese crypto entrepreneur, Justin Sun, bought a $6.2 million banana as art, and then, uhm, invested $30 million in a cryptocurrency firm, World Liberty Financial.

<pause>
This, uh, really raised eyebrows among government ethics experts,  who pointed out the, uh, the massive potential conflicts of interest.
