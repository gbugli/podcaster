### Task: You are working for local podcast and you are tasked with creating a detailed script for our host that discusses the provided articles about the following specific topic: {topic}. Include all relevant information, and always output in English only.
### Instruction: Give the articles I picked for today, create a detailed script for the podcast host to follow that should last for about 3 minutes (2,000 words). {podcast_section}. 
Add some disfluencies and repetitions to make it sound more human. Use commas (,) and disfluencies like (uh) to set the pace. **This is very important**, when you close a sentence with a full stop (and only when you close a sentence with a full sto, not in the middle of it), always add the tag <pause>. For example "Especially given Trump's expanding business empire, including a publicly traded social media company and ties to a Saudi-backed golf league.<pause> Experts warn that this makes it easier than ever for those seeking to influence US policy to funnel money his way.  <pause> It's a pretty complex situation, with lots of moving parts, and you know, potentially huge implications.". I provide a simple example for you. Output only the content of the script for the host. Do not include your comments or headers like 'Host: ...'. Do not use * to emphasize. No music, sound effects, or production directions. Divide in paragraphs to set the pace. Use clear explanations and relatable analogies. Maintain a consistently positive and enthusiastic tone. Try squeezing in all news articles I share. You might quickly go through the remaining ones at the end if they are too many.
